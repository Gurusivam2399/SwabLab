TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

   * Annotations.
   * Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...).
   * Test that your code is multithread safe.
   *  Flexible test configuration.
   * Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
   * Support for parameters.
   * Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
   * Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...).
   * Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.
   * Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).
   * Dependent methods for application server testing.
